/*
* Refactor the calls from the previous step so that the success callbacks are in-place and anonymous.
* However, this time instead of passing the process data into a console.log, hand the data to the 
* callback passed into the function.
*  
* Make sure you're still handling errors! How you do so is up to you.
*
* Reminder: if the only errors in your spec are "Timeout of 2000ms exceeded", and the callbacks
* are being properly invoked, double check that you've started your server in a terminal.
