# Async Callbacks Mini Sprint

## Callbacks
<p>What is a callback? In concept, a callback (sometimes called a "call-after") is a function passed as a parameter into another function. In practice, they are used to a variety of operations within HOFs (Higher Order Functions).  For example, in the Underbar sprint you experienced callbacks being used as iterators or comparators for many of the array manipulation functions you created.<p>

## Advanced Content
This section is intended for some extra practice, and shouldn't be considered part of the main minisprint.  If you don't have time left to get to it, that's okay.  However, if you want extra practice later, definitely come back and try it!

There are are no tests for this part of the sprint.
